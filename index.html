				Hi! My name is Steven Passey and I love web development. I mainly enjoy working on the backend of websites. 
				In the 6th grade, I created a website for my school classroom on my Mom's AOL Hometown. I put the website 
				address on tear-off strips of paper on our classroom's bulletin board. Students could go on the site and order specialty pencils, pencil sharpeners, and other school supplies with their classroom currency. Later, while in junior high, I made
				a website for my Trackmaina game server. Trackmania was a racing game, and, on my website, I held a track
				design contest where racers could submit tracks that were then featured on my server. The winning submitters
				earned in-game credits. The site consisted of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP. In high school, I learned
				other programming languages like C++ & C# on my own, and in my senior year, I took a game development class that used Game Maker.
				After high school, I continued developing in PHP/Javascript in my time working at a library in mesa.
